## Projects

**Since Jan 2019, there’s an 18-month project led by Prague-based publisher [Nová beseda](https://www.novabeseda.cz/page/english) and funded by Technology Agency of the Czech Republic.** In it, Masaryk and Palacký Universities work together towards applied research goals in publishing, experimenting with the medium and transferring annotation affordances from print to digital academic reading.

**Through Feb-Dec 2018, publishers from Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary joined forces** in a project led by Prague-based publisher [Nová beseda](https://www.novabeseda.cz/page/english) and funded by Visegrad Fund. Those teams created several prototypes presented at [next-book.eu](https://next-book.eu/en/).

The original team back in 2017 were [Ivana Lukeš Rybanská](https://github.com/orgs/next-book/people/IvanaRybanska) and [Jan Martinek](http://jan-martinek.com) from Czech Republic.
