  The ideals of early open web.

  Source viewing.

  The power of modern browsers.

  …

  *The future that did not arrive yet.*

This is accomplished by several parts of next-book:

- **[Publisher](https://github.com/next-book/publisher)** that produces the book (adds some info to HTML and puts everything in its place).
- **[Web app interface](https://github.com/next-book/interface)** that is embedded in the book and enhances the reading experience.
- **Cloud apps** that allow personal sync and community experiences (being designed and will be out soon — Q1&nbsp;2020).

## Background

<p class="perex">
  When people ask <i>“Don't you miss something when reading a&nbsp;book in&nbsp;digital?”</i>
  our answer is&nbsp;<i>“Yes!”</i>
</p>

We don't miss _that scent_ and texture though. _That’s what paper books are for._

Paper books are still better in many ways than currently published ebooks.
Computers and networks are still no challenge for the printing press.

<p class="perex">
  Next-book is a vision of tools, formats and affordances for reading, sharing and writing books. It’s a way of thinking about books on the web.
</p>

Next-book does not assume any reading device, publishing process or business model. It assumes only the use of a modern web browser and tries to think about the book experience first, technology second and everything else only after that.

After 30 years of the World Wide Web we might be ready to make it good for serious reading.
