## We have already completed a few projects

### Redesign of library services 2020: web books

Starting in November 2020, together with *Municipal Library of Prague* and *Department of Information Studies and Librarianship* (Masaryk University), we are looking for new ways to provide library services online - especially with the possibilities of webbooks.

As part of the project we are also developing a converter that will enable the creation of web books from the .epub format. Readers will thus be able to read e-books that *the library offers freely available* directly in the browser.

You can find out more about the project on the *Masaryk University* website. The project is supported by the [Technology Agency of the Czech Republic](https://www.tacr.cz/).

### Interactive scholarly books

In 2019-2020 we were part of a project with the subtitle *Definition of electronic publishing in non-fiction* together with the publishing house *Nová beseda*, Masaryk University and Palacký University. The aim was to explore the possibilities of transferring annotation practices in academic reading from print to digital. A sophisticated system of annotating and annotating literature was created within the next-book platform.

More information about the project can be found on *the Masaryk University website*. The project was supported by the *Technology Agency of the Czech Republic*.

### Cooperation of small publishers

Between February and December 2018, publishers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary joined forces in a project led by the Prague-based publishing house Nová Beseda and funded by the Visegrad Fund. These teams created several prototypes of web books presented on [next-book.eu](https://next-book.eu/en/).

### The first next-book

The history of the next-book started with a book on which Honza Martinek collaborated with Ivana Lukeš Rybanská from Nová beseda publishing house. We started with the goal of creating an interactive version of the book for the web, but soon found ourselves deep in the rabbit hole of web reading and web book publishing. The result was the book *What's New in Film Science*, which you can read [on the Nová beseda publishing house website](https://novabeseda.cz/page/nextbook). After many years, it also serves as a reflection on the road we have traveled.
