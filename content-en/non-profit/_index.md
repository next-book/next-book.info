title: We are a tech non-profit
perex: We want a world in which digital book publishing uses web tech and is based on an open foundation. We want digital books to be a full-fledged medium and an emancipatory force. So we founded a non-profit. ✨

  ## Why not a start-up?

  Our goal isn’t to make a quick buck, but to create a sustainable platform whose stability helps everyone who uses it - publishers, readers and other institutions that make the book ecosystem so interesting. 

  We want to create an organisation that can earn its keep (however, you can support [us at Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nextbook/posts)), while at the same time independently guaranteeing the quality and development of web books.

      **Reading belongs to the people**  
      Web books have a chance to break our dependence on actors who exploit the book market just to make money. Plus, they are beautiful and easy to read.

      **Exploring the frontiers of e-books**  
      The design and typography of contemporary e-books is stuck in the state of consumer goods. In books on the web, on the other hand, I sense a disruptive potential to return graphic design back into the text and to revive the intimate book-reader relationship.

      **Thinking about the future of books**  
      I'm hoping for a reading experience that takes off from paper, PDF and commercial readers and finds its place in open platforms on the web - the medium has already been created, let's re-create it and make it better.

      **An enjoyable read on the web? That'll be great!**  
      I like being part of this foolish idea to weave a meaningful e-book format in amongst the clutter that prevails in this area so far. And she every strong idea is foolish to begin with.

      **I connect our work to research and practice**  
      For me, webbooks are a means of designing, experimenting and thinking about (alternative) futures of books and reading.
