OWP;UC 1;"A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based journal relies on traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for its content. The journal, responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer.";OWP;
OWP;UC 2;Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP features. In addition to video, audio, and animations, they may also include interactive exams (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of algorithms, and built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses on programming). In many respects, the borderline between these publications and Web applications is becoming fuzzy.;OWP;
OWP;UC 3;A large technology company with extensive “in-house” documentation to support technical and administrative processes and user documentation for their various products, develops all this material in digital-only formats. The quantity of documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents in print. Instead, the company publishes them on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their employees and contractors via specialized mobile applications. These documents, as a type of publication, require accessibility, portability of annotations, and the possible inclusion of complex media.;OWP;annotations
OWP;UC 4;News outlets often rely on video, audio, large images, and interactive elements to enhance their content. Web Publications would allow news outlets to provide this content in a unique, identifiable format that can facilitate archiving and offline access.;OWP;offline access
OWP;UC 5;Image-based narrative content like comics, manga, and graphic novels relies heavily on support for large images. This type of content may also experiment with interactivity and unique forms of navigation.;OWP;
Horizontal Dependencies;UC 6;(On Accessibility) Legal Publishing Ltd. publishes all the official texts as issued by the government of its country. Per local legislation, the publication must be accessible, following W3C’s WCAG Level AA requirements, to serve as official references in courts.;OWP;
Horizontal Dependencies;UC 7;(On Privacy, Accessibility) EducationPublishing Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also include access to interactive tests via specialized services on the Web that regularly access the student’s progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s test data must be preserved. This, and the fact that digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that EducationPublishing may be liable in case they are not fulfilled.;OWP;server
Horizontal Dependencies;UC 8;(On Internationalization) PublicationInternational SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in many languages. In order to continue its business in Japan, it must be able to produce digital publications with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is the only way those publications are accepted by local customers.;OWP;
Horizontal Dependencies;UC 9;(On Privacy) Thomas has written a pamphlet advocating a government overthrow. The government has decreed that the author of the pamphlet as well as its readers of the pamphlet shall be jailed. Thomas needs to distribute the pamphlet in ways that preserve his anonymity and allow the public to read without fear of the government cyber-police.;OWP;low level, network
Horizontal Dependencies;UC 10;(On Device Independence) Yoshio usually reads a book on his tablet when he is at home, but he does not carry his tablet around while commuting on the train. Instead, he prefers to use his phone to continue reading. Publications must be able to adapt to the consumption environment, so as to provide a good reading experience regardless of the device.;OWP;

Escalating trust;UC 12;Luke has written another book, this time using all of the capabilities of the Open Web Platform that he can think of including using the readers location to adapt the content. He submits the book for review to a Web Publication retail platform, where the book is signed by the publisher. When purchased, the UA detects that the book came from a trusted source and has not been modified, therefore allowing it to use the full capabilities of the web platform.;OWP;
Escalating trust;UC 13;Rebecca has assigned an exercise from a WP textbook. The exercise requires the use of geolocation to measure distances from the user’s location to a target. The UA detects that the WP came from a trusted source (the textbook publisher), and therefore allows the WP to use the full capabilities of the UA.;OWP;
Identification;UC 14;Scholarly references demand a unique identification of the publication and, possibly, its internal structure. That unique identification must be available as a Web link, to make it possible for other publications and other sites (e.g., the authors’ institutional sites) to unambiguously link to the publication. These features are essential in the scholarly community to make, for example, the assessment of individual researchers possible.;OWP;internet OWP/publishing (complicated by obscurity)
Identification;UC 15;Textbook editions should be clearly distinct from one another using unique identifiers. Links should be accurate in order to avoid confusion in classes, especially since each class is not necessarily using the latest edition.;OWP;internet publishing
Identification;UC 16;Markus refers to a specific mathematical theorem in a publication. That reference must be unique, stable and retrievable on the Web, and it should not depend on whether the publisher issues a new iteration of the target publication (thereby possibly change the section numbering).;OWP;publisher’s archival?

The professor searches to determine which titles are accessible and therefore suitable for his use. This can be done because the publishers have added the Schema.org Accessibility Metadata to the Web Publication, describing the accessbility characteristics for each constituent resource.;OWP;

Resources;UC 32;Nick is reading a long-form narrative on a device with limited storage: a publication filled with text, images, sounds, and multimedia files. Nick also rides the subway, where he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without warning for long stretches of time. During offline or low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video, such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick to read the content while offline or on a device with limited storage.;packaging;non-essential

However, when she is on the train (without a connection) one week later and opens the stock exchange publication, she will continue to see the value of the stock as it was the last time she opened the publication. It should be possible for either the content itself or the user agent to provide some user experience that notifies her that the currently presented data is a week old.;OWP;live data w/ fallback
